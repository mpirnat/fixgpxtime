A little utility for adjusting the timestamps in GPX files.

RunKeeper is great for generating GPX logs of where you've been (eg, on a
photowalk), but lies when it writes the timestamps.  It uses the local time,
formatted in a way that asserts it was UTC.  But the next software down the line
doesn't know that, trusts the UTC timestamps, and now you can't geotag your
photos.

This fixes that.
