What
----
A little utility for adjusting the timestamps in GPX files.

Why
---
RunKeeper is great for generating GPX logs of where you've been (eg, on a
photowalk), but lies when it writes the timestamps.  It uses the local time,
formatted in a way that asserts it was UTC.  But the next software down the line
doesn't know that, trusts the UTC timestamps, and now you can't geotag your
photos.

This fixes that.

State of the Universe
---------------------

Requires dateutil for convenience.

Crappy things that I'm too lazy to fix right now:

 * hard-coded inputs
 * hard-coded outputs
 * hard-coded time adjustment (4 hours, UTC minus EDT)
 * no tests
 * not easy_install-able
 * not pip install-able
 * not in PyPI/Cheeseshop

Pull requests welcome. :-)
